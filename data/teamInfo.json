        "Cadillac makes history in 2026 as Formula 1's 11th team — the first new entrant to the championship since Haas in 2016. Backed by General Motors and operated with operational input from the Andretti organisation, the team represents America's most significant push into F1 since the sport's US fanbase exploded.",
        "Sergio Pérez and Valtteri Bottas — both returning after a year away from the grid — bring enormous combined experience to a project that aims to be genuinely competitive. Ferrari power units provide a solid technical foundation while GM develops its own power unit, targeted for introduction in 2029."
